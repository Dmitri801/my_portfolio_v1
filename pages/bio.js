                Hey there, welcome to my page! My names Dmitriy, and I have been
                developing websites for around 2 years. My specializations
                include HTML, CSS, and various Javascript libraries and
                frameworks. The main technologies i'm working with currently are
                ReactJS, React Native, and NodeJS. My passion is to build
                engaging, interactive, and inspiring user interfaces, while
                having a ton of fun doing it. I plan to continue expanding my
                skills and be a part of the technologies that will shape our
                lives in the future. Enjoy your stay!
              </p>

                I'm currently working for Netflix Customer Service, and have
                been a part of their Technical Support Research training. I have

                even taking up the leadership role of the team I'm on.
